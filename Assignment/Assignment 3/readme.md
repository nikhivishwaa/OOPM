```
Create a class hierarchy in C++ for different types of vehicles. The base class should be called Vehicle, and it 
should have attributes such as make, model, and year, as well as methods like start() and stop().
Derived classes should include Car, Motorcycle, and Truck. Each of these classes should inherit from the Vehicle 
class and include class-specific attributes and methods.
For example, the Car class may have additional attributes like num_doors and fuel_type. The Motorcycle class could 
have attributes like top_speed and engine_type. The Truck class might have attributes such as load_capacity and 
transmission_type.
Implement the classes with their specific attributes and methods and create instances of each class to demonstrate the 
functionality of inheritance```
