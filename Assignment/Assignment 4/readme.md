```
Create a C++ program that demonstrates function overloading for a class called Calculator. The Calculator class 
should have multiple methods named add, each with a different number of parameters.
The first add method should accept two integers and return their sum.
The second add method should accept three integers and return their sum.
The third add method should accept two floating-point numbers and return their sum.
Create instances of the Calculator class and demonstrate the use of these overloaded add methods by performing 
various addition operations with different numbers of arguments.
